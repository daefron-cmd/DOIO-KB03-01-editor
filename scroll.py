"""ScrollEngine: MX-Master-style scroll wheel emulation for the outer
encoder. Pure inertia state machine + macOS event posting.

The state machine and the Quartz post are split: pass `post_scroll`
(a callable taking pixels, scroll_phase, momentum_phase) into the
engine so the model is unit-testable without macOS.
